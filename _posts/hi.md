Hello and welcome to my blog, this is my first ever post and as such I intend this post to be an introduction about my intention of this space. There are many reasons circling in my head as to why I created this blog. One such reason is to create a personal corner of the internet I can call mine. Another reason is the inspiration from other bloggers such as: [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/), [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/), and [Trevor Dick](https://www.canvasofthinking.com/). The people I've listed create content that possesses traits of intentionality and quality that is rare to find on the internet. I also see creating a personal website as a rite of passage given my professional trade of being a software developer. Overall, writing to me is a way to expand and verify the things I have learned, and that seems like a worthy pursuit. If you’re curious about tech, hobbies, or the odd personal ramble, I hope you’ll stick around.
