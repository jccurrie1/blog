Hello and welcome to my blog, this is my first ever post and as such I intend this post to be an introduction about my intention of this space. There are many reasons circling in my head as to why I created this blog. One such reason is to create a personal corner of the internet I can call mine. Another reason for creating my personal corner of the internet is down to the inspiration of [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/), [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/), and [Trevor Dick](https://www.canvasofthinking.com/). The people I have listed create content, that in my opinion, possess traits of intentionality and quality that is rare to find on the internet. I also see creating a personal website as a right of passage given my professional trade of being a software developer. With all of that said, during the life of this blog I want to write about a series of topics such as tech, hobbies, and other personal interests. Overall, writing to me is a way to expand and verify the things I have learned, and that seems like a worthy pursuit.
